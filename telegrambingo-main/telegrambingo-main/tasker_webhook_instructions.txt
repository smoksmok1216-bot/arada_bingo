Tasker Webhook Configuration Instructions:

Production Webhook URL:
https://bingoblaster.addisumelke01.repl.co/webhook/deposit

Required Headers:
Content-Type: application/json

Payload Format:
{
  "amount": [Extract amount from SMS],
  "phone": [Extract phone number from SMS]
}

Tasker Configuration Steps:
1. Create a new Profile:
   - Event → Phone → Received Text
   - Configure SMS filter based on your bank's message format

2. Create a Task:
   - Add Action → Net → HTTP Post
   - URL: https://bingoblaster.addisumelke01.repl.co/webhook/deposit
   - Headers: Content-Type:application/json
   - Body:
     {
       "amount": %amount,
       "phone": %phone
     }
   (Replace %amount and %phone with your Tasker variables that extract these values from the SMS)

Testing:
1. First test the webhook format:
   Test URL: https://bingoblaster.addisumelke01.repl.co/webhook/test
   Method: POST
   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   Body Format:
   {
     "amount": [amount from SMS],
     "phone": [phone from SMS]
   }
   This will validate your data format without processing the deposit.

2. Once format is confirmed, use the main deposit URL for production.  The production endpoint expects the same `Content-Type` and body format as the test endpoint.

Example SMS Pattern:
For the amount variable, extract the number after "ETB" or "Birr"
For the phone variable, extract the sender's phone number or account number

Example body:
{
  "amount": 100.0,
  "phone": "0911234567"
}

Important Notes:
- Ensure amounts are sent as numbers (e.g., 100.0, not "100 Birr")
- Phone numbers should be in format: "0911234567" (no spaces or special characters)
- Test the webhook setup before using it with real transactions
